more html and css practice - fake twitter landing page from scratch

looks good, just need to learn better practice for responsive design. I set percentages for the section margins, but when building next time I need to take into account each container (the items) as well, and set those as relative percentages. Also, look into other methods for repsonsive design, percentages is probably not the only one.
